Market State Manager for HBAR/USDT Trading

Overview:
The StateManager class in state_manager.py is a Python-based tool for determining the market state (uptrend, downtrend, sideways) for the HBAR/USDT pair on Binance.US. It uses technical indicators (EMA12, EMA26, RSI14, ADX14) from the IndicatorCalculator and kline data from the DataManager to assess short-term (1-hour) and long-term (1-day) market trends, guiding trading decisions in the GridManager.

Purpose:

    Analyze market conditions to classify trends as uptrend, downtrend, or sideways.
    Support GridManager in enabling/disabling trading based on market state.
    Use 1-hour and 1-day kline data for short-term and long-term trend analysis.
    Integrate with IndicatorCalculator for indicator data and DataManager for kline buffers.
    Log market state determinations and errors for debugging.

Requirements:

    Python 3.8 or higher.
    Packages: None (uses standard library).
    Components:
        DataManager (data_manager.py) for kline data buffers.
        IndicatorCalculator (indicator_calculator.py) for technical indicators.
        OrderOperations (order_operations.py) for integration with GridManager.
    Linux system (assumed for compatibility with related project files).
    Logging configured in the calling application to capture debug logs.

Setup:

    Ensure state_manager.py is in the project directory (e.g., /home/jason/algorithmic_trading_binance/hbar_mainnet_bot/).
    Verify dependencies:
        No additional packages required (uses standard library).
        Ensure DataManager, IndicatorCalculator, and OrderOperations are available.
    Confirm integration with other components:
        GridManager (grid_manager.py) for market state-based trading decisions.
        hbarGridBotMainNet.py for bot orchestration.
    Set up logging in the main application (e.g., RotatingFileHandler in hbarGridBotMainNet.py) to capture StateManager logs if debug mode is enabled.
    Ensure DataManager provides valid 1-hour and 1-day kline buffers for the symbol.

Usage:
The StateManager class is instantiated and used programmatically within the trading bot, typically called by GridManager to determine market states for trading decisions.

Instantiation:
from state_manager import StateManager
state_manager = StateManager(data_manager, indicator_calculator, order_operations, symbol, debug)

Parameters:

    data_manager: DataManager instance for kline data access.
    indicator_calculator: IndicatorCalculator instance for technical indicators.
    order_operations: OrderOperations instance (used by GridManager).
    symbol: Trading pair (e.g., 'HBARUSDT').
    debug: Boolean to enable verbose logging (default: False).

Key Method:

    get_market_state(symbol, timeframe): Returns the market state ('uptrend', 'downtrend', 'sideways', or None) for the specified timeframe ('1d' or '1h').

Example:
from state_manager import StateManager
from data_manager import DataManager
from indicator_calculator import IndicatorCalculator
from order_operations import OrderOperations
Assume components are set up

data_manager = DataManager(debug=True)
indicator_calculator = IndicatorCalculator(debug=True)
order_operations = OrderOperations(exchange, 'HBARUSDT', dry_run=True)
state_manager = StateManager(data_manager, indicator_calculator, order_operations, 'HBARUSDT', debug=True)
market_state = state_manager.get_market_state('HBARUSDT', timeframe='1h')
print(f"Market state: {market_state}")

Workflow:

    Initialize StateManager with DataManager, IndicatorCalculator, OrderOperations, symbol, and debug mode.
    Call get_market_state with symbol and timeframe ('1d' or '1h'):
        Fetch kline buffer (klines_1d or klines_1h) from DataManager.
        Compute indicators (EMA12, EMA26, RSI14, ADX14) using IndicatorCalculator.
        Validate indicator data; return None if indicators are unavailable.
    Determine market state based on indicators:
        Sideways: ADX14 < 20.
        Uptrend: EMA12 > EMA26, RSI14 < 70, ADX14 >= 20.
        Downtrend: EMA12 < EMA26, RSI14 > 30, ADX14 >= 20.
        Default to sideways if conditions are not met.
    Log debug information (if enabled) for indicator values and state determination.
    Handle errors by logging and returning None for invalid data or exceptions.
    Return the market state to GridManager for trading decisions.

File Structure:

    /home/jason/algorithmic_trading_binance/hbar_mainnet_bot/
        state_manager.py: Market state determination logic
        data_manager.py: Data management logic (required for kline buffers)
        indicator_calculator.py: Indicator calculation logic (required for indicators)
        order_operations.py: Order management logic (required for GridManager integration)
        grid_manager.py: Grid trading logic (uses StateManager)
        hbarGridBotMainNet.py: Main bot script (orchestrates components)
        Other project files (e.g., exchange_connection.py, key_loader.py)

Output:

    Market State:
        String: 'uptrend', 'downtrend', 'sideways', or None (for invalid data).
        Example: 'uptrend' if EMA12 > EMA26, RSI14 < 70, ADX14 >= 20.
    Logs:
        Debug logs (if enabled) for initialization, indicator values, and state determination.
        Example: "1-day indicators for HBARUSDT: {'ema12': 0.105, 'ema26': 0.104, ...}, state: uptrend"
        Error logs for failures (e.g., "Error determining market state for HBARUSDT: ...").
        Logs saved via main applicationâ€™s logging setup (e.g., logs/grid_bot.log).
    Console Output:
        None directly; relies on IndicatorCalculator for warning/error messages about invalid kline data.

Notes:

    Specific to HBAR/USDT; modify symbol for other pairs.
    Relies on DataManager for valid kline buffers and IndicatorCalculator for accurate indicators.
    Debug mode provides detailed logging but requires external logging configuration.
    Market state logic uses fixed thresholds (e.g., ADX14 < 20, RSI14 < 70) that are not configurable.
    Returns None for invalid data, ensuring GridManager can handle missing states gracefully.

Limitations:

    Hardcoded indicator thresholds limit flexibility (e.g., ADX14 < 20 for sideways).
    No support for additional indicators or custom timeframes beyond 1h/1d.
    Dependent on DataManager and IndicatorCalculator, which must provide valid data.
    Logging requires external setup (e.g., via hbarGridBotMainNet.py).
    No persistent storage for market state history.

Troubleshooting:

    None returned: Check DataManager kline buffers and IndicatorCalculator logs for data issues.
    Invalid states: Verify kline data integrity and indicator calculations in debug mode.
    No logs: Configure logging in the main application (e.g., RotatingFileHandler).
    Timeframe errors: Ensure timeframe is '1d' or '1h'.
    Missing dependencies: Confirm DataManager and IndicatorCalculator are properly set up.

Future Improvements:

    Add configurable thresholds for market state conditions (e.g., ADX, RSI).
    Support additional indicators (e.g., MACD, Bollinger Bands) for state determination.
    Implement persistent storage for market state history (e.g., CSV or database).
    Allow custom timeframes (e.g., 4h, 15m) for flexible analysis.
    Enhance error handling with fallback states or retry logic.
