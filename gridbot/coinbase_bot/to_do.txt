- current coinbaseGridBot or data_manager are trying to update klines once a minute, not a big deal but probably not needed either. 
- fix graceful shutdown
- once you have data_manager, state_manager,and indicator calculator running, run the bot and log them for several days to verify they work correctly. 
- make sure the logging on/off feature is in every module
- make sure kline buffers are updated every thirty minutes or so when the bot is running
- make sure indicator calculations are run every loop
- make sure long and short term state is calculated every loop. 
- fix graceful shutdown to fetch orders from the exchange and then cancel, orders, don't use the dictionary
- reasonably sure bot is not tracking state correctly anymore since the update to multicoin
- accidentally hit the sleep button on the workstation. Bot didn't stop but did start getting 
- redo READMEs and logical flow. 
- port code to linux machine, need to rebuild old workstation
- make bot a service
- add cronjob to restart it
- Port the code to coinbase
- move the bot to aws 
- down the road add futures trading. This could be used to offset a market downtrend. Buy/sell a futures contract that allows me to sell at a higher price than market price when the bot has stopped trading in a downtrend market.
