- redo READMEs and logical flow. 
- port code to linux machine, need to rebuild old workstation
- make bot a service
- add cronjob to restart it
- Port the code to coinbase
- move the bot to aws 
- down the road add futures trading. This could be used to offset a market downtrend. Buy/sell a futures contract that allows me to sell at a higher price than market price when the bot has stopped trading in a downtrend market.
