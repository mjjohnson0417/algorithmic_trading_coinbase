- need to set maximum order amount to 1o open orders and use calculate_order_size to set amount of tokens bought/should-
- how do you actually set a stop loss on coinbase?
- need to track and pair buy/sell/stop loss orders
- determine how much of a token should be on hand for shorting? What to do if there is not token? buy and short?
- method for placing orders
- if this all works, think about how you would simulate a trailing take profit for buy low, sell high and pseudo shorting with tokens
