- think through indicators and their confirmations. Just get something into the dictionary now and refine it later. 
- also need to check for support levels and resistance. 
- once the dictionary is complete, run the bot for a few days and log when it sees conditions. Log what price it should have bought at and what price it should have sold at. Log where the stop loss is. Log the ticker maybe to track the actual price? Ifugre out profitablity using the logs. This would be a better test of the bot's effectivess than a backtest.
