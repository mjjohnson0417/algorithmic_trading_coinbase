Here's my complete start-to-finish process for identifying a trading opportunity:
Phase 1: Market Context Assessment
1. Daily Trend Analysis (Primary Filter)
- Check 1d market state: uptrend/downtrend/sideways
- If uptrend: Only consider bullish setups
- If downtrend: Only consider bearish setups  
- If sideways: Consider both directions at range boundaries
- If unknown/mixed: Skip or use minimal position size
2. Multi-Timeframe Trend Alignment
- Daily (50% weight): Sets overall bias
- 6H (25% weight): Confirms intermediate momentum
- 1H (15% weight): Short-term direction
- 15M (10% weight): Entry timing only

Scoring: 4/4 aligned = 5 points, 3/4 = 3 points, 2/4 = 1 point
Phase 2: Support/Resistance Level Identification
3. Identify Key Levels (Priority Order)
Primary Levels (3 points each):
- Daily pivot S1/R1
- Fibonacci 50% retracement
- VWAP (daily)
- Major horizontal S/R (3+ touches)

Secondary Levels (2 points each):
- Fibonacci 38.2%, 61.8%
- EMA20 (1H or higher timeframe)
- Volume Profile HVN levels
- Weekly pivot points

Tertiary Levels (1 point each):
- EMA10, SMA20
- Pivot S2/R2
- Minor trendlines
4. Proximity Check
- Current price within 0.1-0.5% of key level
- Closer proximity = higher score
- Multiple levels clustered = bonus points
Phase 3: Pattern Recognition
5. Chart Pattern Analysis (6H/1H timeframes)
Bullish Patterns at Support:
- Double bottom, inverse head & shoulders
- Ascending triangle, bull flag
- Falling wedge completion

Bearish Patterns at Resistance:  
- Double top, head & shoulders
- Descending triangle, bear flag
- Rising wedge completion
6. Candlestick Pattern Analysis (1H/15M timeframes)
Bullish at Support:
- Hammer, dragonfly doji
- Bullish engulfing, morning star
- Piercing pattern

Bearish at Resistance:
- Shooting star, gravestone doji  
- Bearish engulfing, evening star
- Dark cloud cover
Phase 4: Confluence Scoring
7. Calculate Total Score
Base Score Components:
+ Pattern strength (1-3 points)
+ S/R level proximity (1-3 points)
+ Trend alignment (1-5 points)
+ Volume confirmation (1 point)
+ Multiple pattern confluence (1-2 points)

Minimum viable score: 6 points
High confidence score: 8+ points
8. Confirmation Indicators
For Bullish Setups:
- RSI < 40 (oversold but not extreme)
- MACD histogram turning positive
- Volume spike on pattern formation
- Price holding above support level

For Bearish Setups:
- RSI > 60 (overbought but not extreme)
- MACD histogram turning negative  
- Volume spike on pattern formation
- Price rejecting resistance level
Phase 5: Trade Execution Decision
9. Final Validation Checklist
✓ Daily trend supports trade direction
✓ Pattern formed at significant S/R level
✓ Multiple timeframes align (3+ out of 4)
✓ Confluence score ≥ 6
✓ Risk/reward ratio ≥ 2:1
✓ No major news/events pending
✓ Position size appropriate for account
10. Entry Strategy
Conservative: Wait for pattern completion + confirmation candle
Aggressive: Enter on pattern formation near key level

Stop Loss Placement:
- Bullish: Below support level or pattern low
- Bearish: Above resistance level or pattern high

Target Levels:
- Primary: Next major S/R level
- Secondary: Fibonacci extensions
- Trail stops in trending markets
