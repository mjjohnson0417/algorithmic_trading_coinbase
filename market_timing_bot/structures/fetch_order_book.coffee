    asks: A list of ask orders. Each ask order is a list with the price and the volume available at that price. Asks are sorted from the lowest (best) price to the highest.
    bids: A list of bid orders. Each bid order is a list with the price and the volume available at that price. Bids are sorted from the highest (best) price to the lowest.
    datetime: A string representing the date and time the order book was fetched.
    timestamp: The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) of when the order book was fetched.

limit Parameter

In the get_order_book function, the limit parameter specifies the maximum number of orders to retrieve from the order book.

    Default Value: Yes, limit=10 is the default value in the function definition provided in the Canvas. If you don't provide a value for limit when calling the function, it will default to 10.
    Not a Hard Cap: It's generally not a hard cap imposed by the exchange itself, but rather a parameter you provide to the ccxt function. The exchange might have its own limits on how much order book data it returns, but ccxt's limit allows you to request a smaller portion of that data.
        In most cases, you can increase the limit to get more orders, but be aware of:
            Exchange Limits: The exchange might restrict the maximum number of orders you can fetch in a single request.
            Performance: Requesting a very large number of orders can increase the response size and slow down your application.
