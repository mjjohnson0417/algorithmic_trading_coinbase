Falling Three Methods

    Definition: A bearish continuation pattern with a long bearish candle, followed by three small bullish candles within the first candle’s range, and a fifth bearish candle closing below the first’s low.
    Criteria (Simplified to three candles):
        First candle: Bearish (first_close < first_open).
        Second candle: Bullish (second_close > second_open), within first body (second_open >= first_close, second_close <= first_open).
        Third candle: Bearish (third_close < third_open), third_close < first_close.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bearish Continuation: Indicates a pause in a downtrend followed by renewed selling pressure.
        Context-Dependent: Effective in a downtrend, often after a pullback.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short at the third candle’s close or on breakdown below the first candle’s low.
        Stop-Loss: Above the second candle’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI < 50, ADX > 25, volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm continuation, check bid_ask_spread.
