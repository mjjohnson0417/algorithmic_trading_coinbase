Bullish Harami Cross

    Definition: A bullish reversal pattern like Bullish Harami, but the second candle is a Doji (open and close nearly equal) contained within the first bearish candle’s body.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bearish (prev_close < prev_open).
        Second candle: Doji (abs(close - open) ≤ 5% of range), with open >= prev_close and close <= prev_open.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Stronger Bullish Reversal: The Doji indicates greater indecision than a bullish candle, enhancing reversal potential.
        Context-Dependent: Very strong at support levels post-downtrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Long on confirmation (e.g., bullish candle above the Doji’s high).
        Stop-Loss: Below the first candle’s low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 30-50, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio > 1.5, order_book_imbalance > 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm breakout, monitor bid_ask_spread.
