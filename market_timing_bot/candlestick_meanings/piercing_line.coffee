Piercing Line

    Definition: A bullish reversal pattern where a bearish candle is followed by a bullish candle that opens below the previous low and closes above the previous candle’s midpoint.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bearish (prev_close < prev_open).
        Second candle: Bullish (close > open), with open < prev_low and close > (prev_open + prev_close)/2.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bullish Reversal: Suggests strong buying after a bearish gap, indicating a bottom.
        Context-Dependent: Strong at support levels post-downtrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Long at the second candle’s close or on confirmation (e.g., breakout above the bullish candle’s high).
        Stop-Loss: Below the second candle’s low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 30-50, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance > 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, stops below low, check bid_ask_spread.
