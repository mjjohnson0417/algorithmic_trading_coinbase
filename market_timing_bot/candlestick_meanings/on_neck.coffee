On Neck

    Definition: A bearish continuation pattern where a bearish candle is followed by a bullish candle that opens below the previous low and closes at or near the previous close.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bearish (prev_close < prev_open).
        Second candle: Bullish (close > open), with open < prev_low and abs(close - prev_close) ≤ 0.0001.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bearish Continuation: Suggests a failed bullish recovery, with sellers maintaining control.
        Context-Dependent: Effective in a downtrend, often after a pullback.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short on confirmation (e.g., bearish candle below the second candle’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the second candle’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 40-60, ADX > 25, volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm continuation, monitor bid_ask_spread.
