Bearish Harami Cross

    Definition: A bearish reversal pattern like Bearish Harami, but the second candle is a Doji contained within the first bullish candle’s body.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bullish (prev_close > prev_open).
        Second candle: Doji (abs(close - open) ≤ 5% of range), with open <= prev_close and close >= prev_open.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Stronger Bearish Reversal: The Doji signals significant indecision, increasing reversal likelihood.
        Context-Dependent: Strong at resistance levels post-uptrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short on confirmation (e.g., bearish candle below the Doji’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the first candle’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 50-70, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio > 1.5, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
