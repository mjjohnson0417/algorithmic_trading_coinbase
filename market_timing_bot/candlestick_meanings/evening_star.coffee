Evening Star

    Definition: A bearish reversal pattern with three candles: a long bullish candle, a short-bodied candle (indecision), and a long bearish candle closing below the first candle’s midpoint.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bullish (first_close > first_open).
        Second candle: Small body (abs(second_close - second_open) ≤ 30% of range), often gapping up.
        Third candle: Bearish (third_close < third_open), closing below first_midpoint.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bearish Reversal: Indicates a shift from buying to selling pressure, often at a top.
        Indecision to Weakness: The middle candle shows hesitation, followed by strong selling.
        Context-Dependent: Strong at resistance levels (pivot_points.r1, 61.8% Fibonacci) after an uptrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short at the third candle’s close or on confirmation (e.g., breakdown below the third candle’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the second candle’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (pivot_points.s1, 38.2% Fibonacci, 2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 50-70, ADX < 25, high volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage (2-5x), stops above high, check bid_ask_spread.
