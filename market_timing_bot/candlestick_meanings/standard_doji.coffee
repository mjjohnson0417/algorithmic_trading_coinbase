Standard Doji

    Definition: A neutral pattern with a very small body (open and close nearly equal), indicating indecision. Shadows can vary but are typically balanced.
    Criteria:
        Body: abs(close - open) ≤ 5% of range.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Indecision: Suggests a pause in trend, with buyers and sellers in equilibrium, often preceding a breakout or reversal.
        Context-Dependent: Significant at support/resistance, after strong trends, or with confirmation (e.g., marubozu_bullish or marubozu_bearish).
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Wait for confirmation (e.g., bullish candle for long, bearish for short) at key levels (fibonacci_levels).
        Stop-Loss: Below/above the Doji’s low/high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Target next support/resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 40-60, ADX < 20, high volume_surge_ratio, check order_book_imbalance.
        Futures Notes: Use low leverage, confirm direction to avoid false breakouts, monitor bid_ask_spread.
