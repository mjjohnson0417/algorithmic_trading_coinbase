Rising Three Methods

    Definition: A bullish continuation pattern with a long bullish candle, followed by three small bearish candles within the first candle’s range, and a fifth bullish candle closing above the first’s high.
    Criteria (Simplified to three candles for consistency):
        First candle: Bullish (first_close > first_open).
        Second candle: Bearish (second_close < second_open), within first body (second_open <= first_close, second_close >= first_open).
        Third candle: Bullish (third_close > third_open), third_close > first_close.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bullish Continuation: Indicates a pause in an uptrend followed by renewed buying pressure.
        Context-Dependent: Effective in an uptrend, often after a pullback.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Long at the third candle’s close or on breakout above the first candle’s high.
        Stop-Loss: Below the second candle’s low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI > 50, ADX > 25, volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance > 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm continuation, monitor bid_ask_spread.
