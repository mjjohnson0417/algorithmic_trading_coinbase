1. Bullish Engulfing

    Definition: A bullish reversal pattern where a small bearish candle is followed by a larger bullish candle that completely engulfs the previous candle’s body.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bearish (prev_close < prev_open).
        Second candle: Bullish (close > open), with open <= prev_close and close >= prev_open.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bullish Reversal: Indicates strong buying pressure overpowering sellers, often at the end of a downtrend.
        Momentum Shift: The larger bullish candle suggests buyers have taken control.
        Context-Dependent: Strongest at support levels (e.g., fibonacci_levels, pivot_points.s1) after a decline.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Long at the second candle’s close or on confirmation (e.g., breakout above the bullish candle’s high).
        Stop-Loss: Below the first candle’s low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next resistance (pivot_points.r1, 61.8% Fibonacci, 2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 30-50, ADX < 25, high volume_surge_ratio (>1.5), order_book_imbalance > 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Use 2-5x leverage, set stops beyond the low, monitor bid_ask_spread.
