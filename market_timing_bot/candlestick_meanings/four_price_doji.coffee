Four Price Doji

    Definition: A rare pattern where open, close, high, and low are equal, indicating extreme indecision.
    Criteria:
        open == close == high == low (within a small tolerance, e.g., 0.0001 for HBAR-USD).
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Complete Indecision: No price movement, suggesting a standoff between buyers and sellers.
        Context-Dependent: Rare but significant at key levels, often before large moves.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Wait for breakout confirmation (long/short based on direction).
        Stop-Loss: Beyond breakout range (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support/resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 40-60, ADX < 20, high volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance for direction.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm breakout, monitor bid_ask_spread.
