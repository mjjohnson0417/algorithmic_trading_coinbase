Tweezer Bottoms

    Definition: A bullish reversal pattern where two candles have similar lows, with the first bearish and the second bullish, indicating support rejection.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bearish (prev_close < prev_open).
        Second candle: Bullish (close > open).
        Lows nearly equal: abs(low - prev_low) ≤ 0.0001.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bullish Reversal: Suggests a failed attempt to break support, with buyers defending the level.
        Context-Dependent: Strong at support levels or after a downtrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Long on confirmation (e.g., bullish candle above the second candle’s high).
        Stop-Loss: Below the shared low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 30-50, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance > 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, stops below low, check bid_ask_spread.
