Bearish Stick Sandwich

    Definition: A bearish reversal pattern with a bullish candle, a bearish candle with a lower close, and another bullish candle with a close near the first candle’s close.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bullish (first_close > first_open).
        Second candle: Bearish (second_close < second_open), second_close < first_close.
        Third candle: Bullish (third_close > third_open), abs(third_close - first_close) ≤ 0.0001.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bearish Reversal: Suggests sellers defended a resistance level, sandwiching a bearish candle between bullish ones.
        Context-Dependent: Effective at resistance levels after an uptrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short on confirmation (e.g., bearish candle below the second candle’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the first candle’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 50-70, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm breakdown, check bid_ask_spread.
