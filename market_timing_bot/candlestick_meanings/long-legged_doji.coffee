Long-Legged Doji

    Definition: A Doji with long upper and lower shadows, indicating high volatility and indecision.
    Criteria:
        Body: abs(close - open) ≤ 5% of range.
        Shadows: Upper and lower shadows each ≥ 30% of range.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Extreme Indecision: Reflects a battle between buyers and sellers, often at turning points.
        Context-Dependent: Strong at key levels or after trends, signaling potential reversals or breakouts.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Confirm direction with follow-up candle (long/short based on breakout).
        Stop-Loss: Beyond Doji’s high/low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support/resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 40-60, ADX < 20, high volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance for direction.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm breakout to avoid whipsaws, check bid_ask_spread.
