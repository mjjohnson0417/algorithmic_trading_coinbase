Tweezer Tops

    Definition: A bearish reversal pattern where two candles have similar highs, with the first bullish and the second bearish, indicating a rejection at resistance.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bullish (prev_close > prev_open).
        Second candle: Bearish (close < open).
        Highs nearly equal: abs(high - prev_high) ≤ 0.0001 (tolerance for HBAR-USD).
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bearish Reversal: Suggests a failed attempt to break resistance, with sellers stepping in.
        Context-Dependent: Strong at resistance levels or after an uptrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short on confirmation (e.g., bearish candle below the second candle’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the shared high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 50-70, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, stops above high, monitor bid_ask_spread.
