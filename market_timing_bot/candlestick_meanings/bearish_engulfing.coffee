Bearish Engulfing

    Definition: A bearish reversal pattern where a small bullish candle is followed by a larger bearish candle that engulfs the previous candle’s body.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bullish (prev_close > prev_open).
        Second candle: Bearish (close < open), with open >= prev_close and close <= prev_open.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bearish Reversal: Suggests strong selling pressure overwhelming buyers, often at the end of an uptrend.
        Momentum Shift: The larger bearish candle indicates seller dominance.
        Context-Dependent: Strongest at resistance levels (pivot_points.r1, 61.8% Fibonacci).
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short at the second candle’s close or on confirmation (e.g., breakdown below the bearish candle’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the first candle’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (pivot_points.s1, 38.2% Fibonacci, 2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 50-70, ADX < 25, high volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage (2-5x), stops above high, check bid_ask_spread.
