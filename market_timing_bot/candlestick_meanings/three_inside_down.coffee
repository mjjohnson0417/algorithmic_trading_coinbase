Three Inside Down

    Definition: A bearish reversal pattern starting with a bullish candle, followed by a Bearish Harami (small bearish candle within the first body), and a third bearish candle closing below the second’s low.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bullish (first_close > first_open).
        Second candle: Bearish (second_close < second_open), within first body (second_open <= first_close, second_close >= first_open).
        Third candle: Bearish (third_close < third_open), third_close < second_close.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Confirmed Bearish Reversal: Extends Bearish Harami with a strong bearish close, indicating seller commitment.
        Context-Dependent: Strong at resistance levels post-uptrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short at the third candle’s close or on confirmation (e.g., breakdown below the third candle’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the first candle’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 50-70, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio > 1.5, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm breakdown, check bid_ask_spread.
