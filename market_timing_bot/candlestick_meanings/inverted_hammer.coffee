1. Inverted Hammer

    Definition: A bullish reversal pattern, typically at the end of a downtrend, with a small body (close near open), a long upper shadow (at least 2x the body), and a minimal or no lower shadow.
    Criteria:
        Body: abs(close - open) ≤ 30% of range (high - low).
        Upper shadow: high - max(open, close) ≥ 2x body.
        Lower shadow: min(open, close) - low ≤ 0.5x body.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bullish Reversal Potential: Suggests buyers tested higher prices, but sellers pushed back, yet buyers held the close near the open, indicating potential exhaustion of sellers.
        Buyer Interest: The long upper shadow shows buying attempts, hinting at a shift in sentiment.
        Context-Dependent: Strongest at support levels (e.g., Fibonacci, pivot_points.s1) after a downtrend. Less reliable in uptrends or choppy markets.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Enter a long position at the close or on confirmation (e.g., bullish candle or breakout above the Inverted Hammer’s high). Best at support levels (fibonacci_levels).
        Stop-Loss: Below the Inverted Hammer’s low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Target next resistance (pivot_points.r1, 61.8% Fibonacci, 2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 30-50, ADX < 25, high volume_surge_ratio (>1.5), order_book_imbalance > 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Use 2-5x leverage, set stops beyond the low to avoid stop-hunts, monitor bid_ask_spread for liquidity.
