. Shooting Star

    Definition: A bearish reversal pattern, typically at the end of an uptrend, with a small body, a long upper shadow (at least 2x the body), and a minimal or no lower shadow.
    Criteria:
        Body: abs(close - open) ≤ 30% of range.
        Upper shadow: high - max(open, close) ≥ 2x body.
        Lower shadow: min(open, close) - low ≤ 0.5x body.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bearish Reversal Potential: Indicates buyers pushed prices up, but sellers overwhelmed them, closing near the open, suggesting a potential top.
        Seller Strength: The long upper shadow shows strong selling at highs.
        Context-Dependent: Strongest at resistance levels (pivot_points.r1, 61.8% Fibonacci) after an uptrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Enter a short position at the close or on confirmation (e.g., bearish candle, breakdown below the Shooting Star’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the Shooting Star’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Target next support (pivot_points.s1, 38.2% Fibonacci, 2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 50-70, ADX < 25, high volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage (2-5x), stops above high to avoid stop-hunts, check bid_ask_spread.
