Dark Cloud Cover

    Definition: A bearish reversal pattern where a bullish candle is followed by a bearish candle that opens above the previous high and closes below the previous candle’s midpoint.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bullish (prev_close > prev_open).
        Second candle: Bearish (close < open), with open > prev_high and close < (prev_open + prev_close)/2.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bearish Reversal: Indicates strong selling after an initial bullish gap, suggesting a top.
        Context-Dependent: Strong at resistance levels post-uptrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short at the second candle’s close or on confirmation (e.g., breakdown below the bearish candle’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the second candle’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 50-70, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, stops above high, monitor bid_ask_spread.
