Three Inside Up

    Definition: A bullish reversal pattern starting with a bearish candle, followed by a Bullish Harami (small bullish candle within the first body), and a third bullish candle closing above the second’s high.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bearish (first_close < first_open).
        Second candle: Bullish (second_close > second_open), within first body (second_open >= first_close, second_close <= first_open).
        Third candle: Bullish (third_close > third_open), third_close > second_close.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Confirmed Bullish Reversal: Extends Bullish Harami with a strong bullish close, indicating buyer commitment.
        Context-Dependent: Strong at support levels post-downtrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Long at the third candle’s close or on confirmation (e.g., breakout above the third candle’s high).
        Stop-Loss: Below the first candle’s low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 30-50, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio > 1.5, order_book_imbalance > 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm breakout, monitor bid_ask_spread.
