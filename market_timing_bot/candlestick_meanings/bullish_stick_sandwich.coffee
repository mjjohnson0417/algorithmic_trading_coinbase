 Bullish Stick Sandwich

    Definition: A bullish reversal pattern with a bearish candle, a bullish candle with a higher close, and another bearish candle with a close near the first candle’s close.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bearish (first_close < first_open).
        Second candle: Bullish (second_close > second_open), second_close > first_close.
        Third candle: Bearish (third_close < third_open), abs(third_close - first_close) ≤ 0.0001.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bullish Reversal: Suggests buyers defended a support level, sandwiching a bullish candle between bearish ones.
        Context-Dependent: Effective at support levels after a downtrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Long on confirmation (e.g., bullish candle above the second candle’s high).
        Stop-Loss: Below the first candle’s low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 30-50, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio, order_book_imbalance > 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm breakout, monitor bid_ask_spread.
