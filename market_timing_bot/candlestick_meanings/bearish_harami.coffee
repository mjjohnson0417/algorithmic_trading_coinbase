Bearish Harami

    Definition: A bearish reversal pattern where a large bullish candle is followed by a smaller bearish candle contained within the previous candle’s body.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bullish (prev_close > prev_open).
        Second candle: Bearish (close < open), with open <= prev_close and close >= prev_open.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bearish Reversal: Indicates a pause in buying pressure, with sellers gaining traction.
        Potential Shift: The smaller bearish candle suggests waning bullish momentum.
        Context-Dependent: Effective at resistance levels after an uptrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Short on confirmation (e.g., bearish candle below the second candle’s low).
        Stop-Loss: Above the first candle’s high (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next support (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 50-70, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio > 1.2, order_book_imbalance < 0.5.
