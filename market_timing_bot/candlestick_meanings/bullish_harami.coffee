Bullish Harami

    Definition: A bullish reversal pattern where a large bearish candle is followed by a smaller bullish candle contained within the previous candle’s body.
    Criteria:
        First candle: Bearish (prev_close < prev_open).
        Second candle: Bullish (close > open), with open >= prev_close and close <= prev_open.
    What It Tells a Trader:
        Bullish Reversal: Suggests a pause in selling pressure, with buyers starting to emerge.
        Potential Shift: The smaller bullish candle indicates reduced bearish momentum.
        Context-Dependent: Effective at support levels after a downtrend.
    How to Trade It:
        Entry: Long on confirmation (e.g., bullish candle above the second candle’s high).
        Stop-Loss: Below the first candle’s low (1-2x atr14).
        Take-Profit: Next resistance (2-3x risk).
        Confirmation: RSI 30-50, ADX < 25, volume_surge_ratio > 1.2, order_book_imbalance > 0.5.
        Futures Notes: Low leverage, confirm breakout, monitor bid_ask_spread.
